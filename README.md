# Professional-Website

The website consists of three pages: a homepage, a page for the resume, and a page for contact information. Each page contains a navigation bar with links to each of the pages. The homepage contains a brief welcome message and a link to download a PDF of the resume. 

Features I plan to implement in the future include designing the button to have some style instead of plain text, as well as a background color/theme instead of plain black and white.
